CosmJS is a library created to talk to the Cosmos SDK. It can be used to create wallets, explorers, Interâ€‘Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) relayers, and other decentralized applications (DApps). It is written in TypeScript and can therefore be client or server-side. Laconic uses a fork of the CosmJS project.
