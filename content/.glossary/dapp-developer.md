DApp developers write distributed applications that require access to blockchain data. To get that data, they enter into agreements with {{< glossary "service-provider" "Service Providers" >}} to access to caches of blockchain data produced by {{< glossary "watcher" "Watchers" >}}. Developers use the {{< glossary "laconic-sdk" "Laconic SDK" >}} to query the Watchers.
