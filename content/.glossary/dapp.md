A decentralized application (DApp) is an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that runs on a decentralized computing, blockchain system. Like traditional applications, DApps provide some function or utility to their users. However, unlike traditional applications, DApps operate without human intervention and are not owned by any single entity. Rather, DApps distribute tokens that represent ownership. These tokens are distributed according to a programmed algorithm to the users of the system, diluting ownership and control of the DApp. Without any single entity controlling the system, the application becomes decentralized.

Decentralized applications have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as the Ethereum blockchain, on which DApps are built.

The trustless and transparent nature of DApps has led to greater developments in the utilization of these features within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

DApps are divided into 17 categories: exchanges, games, finance, gambling, development, storage, high-risk, wallet, governance, property, identity, media, social, security, energy, insurance, and health.
