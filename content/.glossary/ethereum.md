Ethereum is public, decentralized {{< glossary "blockchain" "blockchain" >}} that supports {{< glossary "smartcontract" "smart contracts" >}}, DApps, and DeFi.

Ethereum currently uses a proof-of-work mechanism for achieving consensus among nodes, with plans to change to a proof-of-stake mechanism. 

Like other blockchain technologies, Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency called Ether. The purpose of this currency is to be able to pay for computation time required for performing transactions or calling smart contracts.  

Ethereum is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest blockchain by market capitalization.

The Laconic Network is initially focusing on indexing and serving data from Ethereum.
