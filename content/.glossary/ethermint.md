Ethermint is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake (POS) blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. It is built using the Cosmos SDK, which runs on top of Tendermint Core consensus engine.

Ethermint allows for running vanilla Ethereum as a Cosmos application-specific blockchain. This allows developers to have all the desired features of Ethereum while at the same time benefitting from Tendermint's PoS implementation. Also, because Ethermint is built on top of the Cosmos SDK, it's able to exchange value with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

Laconic runs Ethermint for Ethereum network compatibility as part of its Tendermint Cosmos SDK-based chain.
