`go-ethereum` is one of the three original implementations of the Ethereum protocol. It is written in Go, while the other two are written in C++ and Python, respectively. `go-ethereum` is licensed under the GNU LGPL v3.

The `go-ethereum` project provides both a standalone client called {{< glossary "geth" "Geth" >}} and a Go library.
