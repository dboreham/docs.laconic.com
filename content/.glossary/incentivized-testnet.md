Incentivized testnets, similar to other Cosmos SDK-based incentivized testnets, identify potential Members who are technically qualified to operate as a {{< glossary "validator" "Validator" >}}.

The incentivized testnets determine potential Members by using an on-chain history of Validators correctly performing three core functions of the Network:

1. Serve a minimum amount of data, with a low percentage of failures or disputes (e.g., become a service provider)
2. Demonstrate participation in consensus
3. Inject state from Ethereum into Laconic Network (e.g., not only run a Watcher but run the full Laconic Stack)
