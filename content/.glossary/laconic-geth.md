`laconic-geth` is a fork of {{< glossary "go-ethereum" "`go-ethereum`" >}} that provides additional functionality for supporting several mechanisms and processes of the Laconic Stack, such as processing [statediff objects]({{< relref statediff-object >}}), relaying state objects to RPC subscribers, or writing them to a database.
