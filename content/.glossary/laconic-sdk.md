The Laconic SDK is a toolkit that enables developers to populate custom caches of IPLD blocks called Watchers. For Laconic SDK to provide all its features to Watcher developers, services additional to the core are required. All services in {{< glossary "laconic-stack" "Laconic Stack" >}} provide GraphQL endpoints, which serve IPLD blocks and proofs.
