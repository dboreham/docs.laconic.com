Layer 2 is a scaling solution on top of Ethereum's base layer. It was introduced for enabling high transaction throughput without sacrificing security. Optimistic Rollup is a Layer-2 construct that allows running smart contracts at scale. ORUs run an EVM-compatible virtual machine called Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM). Optimistic Rollups assume that aggregators run without committing fraud (hence the attribute "optimistic").
