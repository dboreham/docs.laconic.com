Provability is the ability to prove that any data served by the {{< glossary "laconic-network" "Laconic Network" >}} is valid and untampered with. The {{< glossary "laconic-stack" "Laconic Stack" >}} preserves the provability of data by deriving new data sets from the {{< glossary "ethereum" "Ethereum" >}} {{< glossary "blockchain" "blockchain" >}} in a provable way and non-destructively converting that data into {{< glossary "ipld" "IPLD" >}} blocks.
