"Smart contracts" are software stored on a blockchain, programmed to execute autonomously when a given set of predetermined conditions are met. They can automate the execution of agreements between participants in a smart contract without the need for human intervention, involvement of intermediaries, or delay. The execution and outcome are guaranteed. In the same vein, they can also be used for workflow automation, triggering the next action when conditions are met.
