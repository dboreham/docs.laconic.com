Service Providers run Watchers on behalf of Watcher Publishers (Dapp developers) and serve data to end users. For any given Watcher, Service Providers will form a Federated Cache. In the Service Provider Marketplace, Watcher Publishers will be matched with Service Providers, who will form the Federated Cache for that Watcher.
