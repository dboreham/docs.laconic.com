Service Providers may or may not be Member Validators (but all MVs must be SPs). Service Providers are the parties who run Watchers and serve data to end users. For any given Watcher, Service Providers will form a Federated Cache. In the Service Provider Marketplace, Watcher Writers will be matched with Service Providers, who will form the Federated Cache for that Watcher. Both Service Providers and Watchers Writers will then earn a fee everytime that Watcher is called upon for verifiable data.
