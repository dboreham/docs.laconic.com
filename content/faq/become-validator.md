Laconic LLC Members are the only possible Validators of the Laconic Network. To become a Member Validator, you must complete an incentivized testnet that verifies technical competency, show proof of reserves, and participate in an auction among other potential Member Validators. Furthermore, validators participate in the governance of a legal membership and must provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information to Laconic.	 	 	 

To act as a Validator, you must:

1. Serve a minimum amount of data, with a low percentage of failures or disputes (for example, become a service provider).
2. Demonstrate participation in consensus.					
3. Inject state from Ethereum into Laconic Network (for example, not only run a Watcher but run the full Laconic Stack).
