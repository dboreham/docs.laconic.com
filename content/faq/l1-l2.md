Since LNâ€™s principal purpose is to make blockchain data more accessible by simplifying and securing its purchase, it's best to think of LN as an overlay of a collection of existing layer 1 (L1) and layer 2 (L2) networks. It may also be helpful to think of LN more simply as an L2 that helps make Ethereum and other blockchain data more available to end-users.
