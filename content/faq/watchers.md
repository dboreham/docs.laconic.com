Watchers are customized queries of blockchain data (including specific views of blockchain state and data expressed as mini-blockchains) written against specific smart contracts. They make verifiable copies of Ethereum data available to DApp end users by connecting to ipld-eth-servers, each other, and browsers via GraphQL over HTTPS, WebSockets, or WebRTC. DApp developers can access these custom data transformations via the Watcher registry, a marketplace that facilitates the registration and discovery of Watchers. Furthermore, DApps use Watchers to fetch, cache, and query their DAppâ€™s data, while Laconic coordinates with the Watchers to scale fetching queries and share verified cached results. There will be token incentives for programmers who write Watchers.
