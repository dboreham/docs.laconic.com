A Watcher Publisher writes {{< glossary "watcher" "Watchers" >}} to be put up for auction on the Laconic Network. At auction, {{< glossary "service-provider" "Service Providers" >}} bid for the right to run the Watchers. Approved Watchers are listed in the {{< glossary "watcher-registry" "Watcher Registry" >}}, which facilitates their discovery by DApp developers who require access to the data.
